README.

Explanation of files used for the two image classification tasks:

1)CNN trained from the scratch
-lenet.py  is the used network architecture
-train_network.py  is the training launch
-predict.py  is the launch for compute predictions over the test_dataset

2)TRANSFER LEARNING FROM INCEPTION-V3 
-classify.py  launched to download the pre-trained model and can be already tested to classify external photos
-retrain.py  is the training launch with the Weather Dataset, where I did the hyperparams tuning
-label.py  is the file used to copute predictions of labels over the test_dataset
